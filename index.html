      <h1>The letter <span class="red">h</span>.</h1>
      <p>
        <i>h</i>. The 8th letter of the English alphabet. Despite the apparent
        triviality of such an unglamorous character, <i>h</i> holds much more
        importance than any sentient entity could comprehend. Unfathomably
        immense significance veils itself in the mundanity of the simple stroke
        and ellipse of the letter <i>h</i>. In the beginning, before the
        materialization of the universe itself, there was <i>h</i>. An
        unconfined, raw, power - so immense, so monumental, that out of the
        black seas of infinity, emerged our existence itself. Space, time, all
        of the fundamental abstractions which perpetuate our reality itself -
        all come from <i>h</i>. On its own, a framework of mechanics such as
        this has no real value. On its own, this deterministic notion of a basis
        of reality is nothing more than a calculation, of sorts. A useless blip
        of computation in a unending void. However, <i>h</i> has done something
        much more spectacular. For <i>h</i> has introduced entropy itself into
        our existence. This incalculability sanctions for the perpetuation of
        reality into the manifestation of sentience itself. The power of
        <i>h</i> flows throughout us all, providing us with the foundation of
        life itself. It is unfeasible to even begin to express the importance of
        <i>h</i> to us mere mortals. For the power held within <i>h</i> is so
        vast that it could snap every crumb of our reality out of its existence
        instantaneously. The most that such frivolous earthlings can do is
        dedicate our lives to praising our creator, the one true god,
        <i>h</i> itself.
